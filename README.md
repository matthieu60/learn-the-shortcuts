Learn the shortcuts is a browser extension that helps you learn the keyboard shortcuts for some web applications and use those instead of your mouse.

For now, it works for the most useful shortcuts in Gmail and Github

## Installation

Learn the shortcuts is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/learn-the-shortcuts) and will be for Chrome as soon as it's reviewed by the Chrome Web store.

## Usage

Just press and hold **alt** on a supported website and an overlay will show you all the keyboard shortcuts you can use.

*Note:* Keyboard shortcuts are not enabled by default in Gmail. You'll need to enable them by going to Settings > General > Keyboard shortcuts

## Backlog
Here are some features that I plan/hope to implement:

- [ ] Add the Gmail shorctuts that are still missing
- [ ] Welcome screen that explains how to enable keyboard shortcuts in Gmail
- [ ] Google Agenda support
- [ ] Trello support
- [ ] "Evil mode" that prevents from clicking buttons to force keyboard use and accelerate learning
- [ ] Safari extension
- [ ] Edge extension
